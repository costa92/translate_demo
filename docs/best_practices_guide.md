# Unified Knowledge Base System: Best Practices Guide

This guide provides recommendations and best practices for using the Unified Knowledge Base System effectively in various scenarios.

## Document Processing

### Document Preparation

1. **Clean your documents**: Remove unnecessary formatting, headers, footers, and page numbers before adding them to the knowledge base.
2. **Structure your content**: Well-structured documents with clear headings and sections will result in better chunking and retrieval.
3. **Use consistent formatting**: Maintain consistent formatting across your documents for better processing.
4. **Include metadata**: Add relevant metadata to your documents to improve filtering and retrieval.
5. **Optimize images**: If your documents contain images, ensure they are optimized for processing (OCR may be applied to extract text).

### Document Types

Different document types require different approaches:

#### PDF Documents

- Ensure PDFs are searchable (text-based) rather than scanned images
- If using scanned PDFs, apply OCR before adding to the knowledge base
- Consider extracting tables and structured data separately

#### Markdown and Text

- Use consistent heading levels (# for main headings, ## for subheadings, etc.)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for better chunking
- Include metadata in frontmatter (YAML format at the beginning of the document)

#### Web Content

- Clean HTML before processing (remove navigation, ads, etc.)
- Extract the main content area
- Preserve important structural elements (headings, lists, tables)

## Chunking Strategies

### Choosing the Right Chunking Strategy

1. **Recursive Chunking**: Best for general-purpose use with mixed content
   - Good for documents with clear hierarchical structure
   - Adapts to different content types within the same document
   
2. **Sentence Chunking**: Best for question-answering and factual retrieval
   - Preserves sentence boundaries for better context
   - Works well with content that has natural sentence breaks
   
3. **Paragraph Chunking**: Best for conceptual or thematic retrieval
   - Preserves paragraph context
   - Good for essays, articles, and narrative content
   
4. **Fixed Length Chunking**: Best for uniform processing of large volumes
   - Simplest approach with consistent chunk sizes
   - May break semantic units but works well with homogeneous content

### Optimizing Chunk Size

- **Too small**: Chunks may lack sufficient context
- **Too large**: Chunks may contain irrelevant information and reduce retrieval precision
- **Recommended ranges**:
  - Short-form content: 200-500 characters
  - Medium-form content: 500-1500 characters
  - Long-form content: 1000-2000 characters

### Chunk Overlap

- **Purpose**: Ensures context is not lost at chunk boundaries
- **Recommended overlap**: 10-20% of chunk size
- **Adjust based on content**: More overlap for dense, technical content; less for simple, structured content

## Embedding Models

### Choosing the Right Embedding Model

1. **Sentence Transformers**:
   - **Advantages**: Open-source, runs locally, multiple language support
   - **Best for**: General-purpose use, multilingual content, privacy-sensitive applications
   - **Recommended models**: 
     - `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`: Good balance of performance and speed
     - `all-mpnet-base-v2`: Higher quality but slower
     - `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`: For multilingual content

2. **OpenAI Embeddings**:
   - **Advantages**: High quality, regularly updated
   - **Best for**: English content, applications where quality is critical
   - **Recommended models**:
     - `text-embedding-ada-002`: Current standard model

3. **DeepSeek Embeddings**:
   - **Advantages**: Good performance on technical and scientific content
   - **Best for**: Technical documentation, scientific papers

4. **SiliconFlow Embeddings**:
   - **Advantages**: Optimized for enterprise use cases
   - **Best for**: Business documents, internal knowledge bases

### Embedding Caching

- Enable embedding caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Consider the trade-off between cache size and memory usage
- Implement cache invalidation strategies for frequently updated content

## Retrieval Strategies

### Choosing the Right Retrieval Strategy

1. **Semantic Retrieval**:
   - **Best for**: Conceptual questions, paraphrased queries
   - **Advantages**: Understands meaning beyond exact keywords
   - **When to use**: General question-answering, exploratory queries

2. **Keyword Retrieval**:
   - **Best for**: Specific term searches, technical terminology
   - **Advantages**: Precise matching of exact terms
   - **When to use**: Looking for specific terms, names, or codes

3. **Hybrid Retrieval**:
   - **Best for**: Balanced approach for most use cases
   - **Advantages**: Combines benefits of both semantic and keyword approaches
   - **When to use**: General-purpose knowledge bases with mixed content

### Optimizing Top-K Results

- Start with `top_k=5` and adjust based on your specific use case
- Increase for complex queries that require more context
- Decrease for simple, factual queries to reduce noise
- Consider the trade-off between recall (finding all relevant information) and precision (avoiding irrelevant information)

### Reranking

- Enable reranking for improved relevance
- Adjust reranking factor based on your content:
  - Higher values (0.7-0.9) for technical, factual content
  - Lower values (0.3-0.6) for narrative, conceptual content
- Consider the computational cost of reranking for large result sets

## Generation Models

### Choosing the Right Generation Model

1. **OpenAI Models**:
   - **GPT-3.5-Turbo**: Good balance of quality and cost
   - **GPT-4**: Highest quality, best for complex reasoning
   - **Best for**: Production systems where quality is critical

2. **DeepSeek Models**:
   - Good performance on technical content
   - Best for: Technical documentation, scientific applications

3. **SiliconFlow Models**:
   - Optimized for enterprise use cases
   - Best for: Business applications, internal tools

4. **Ollama Models**:
   - Open-source, runs locally
   - Best for: Privacy-sensitive applications, development, testing

### Generation Parameters
