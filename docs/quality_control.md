# Quality Control Mechanisms

This document describes the quality control mechanisms implemented in the unified knowledge base system to ensure high-quality generated answers.

## Overview

The quality control system consists of several components:

1. **Content Filtering**: Prevents harmful or inappropriate content from being generated
2. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates the quality of generated answers based on various criteria
3. **Answer Validation**: Determines whether an answer meets quality standards
4. **Answer Improvement**: Attempts to improve answers that don't meet quality standards

## Content Filtering

Content filtering prevents the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. The system supports multiple filtering levels:

- **None**: No filtering is applied
- **Low**: Only filters the most harmful content
- **Medium**: Balances between permissiveness and safety
- **High**: Strict filtering for sensitive contexts

Content filtering is performed using pattern matching against known harmful patterns. In a production environment, this would be enhanced with more sophisticated techniques such as machine learning models.

## Quality Assessment

Quality assessment evaluates generated answers based on various criteria:

- **Relevance**: How relevant the answer is to the query
- **Accuracy**: Whether the answer contains factual errors
- **Completeness**: Whether the answer fully addresses the query
- **Clarity**: Whether the answer is clear and well-structured

The system supports two quality assessment strategies:

1. **Simple Assessment**: Uses heuristics to evaluate answers
2. **LLM Assessment**: Uses a language model to evaluate answers

### Simple Assessment

Simple assessment uses heuristics to evaluate answers:

- Checks answer length
- Detects uncertainty phrases like "I don't know"
- Evaluates relevance based on keyword overlap with the query

### LLM Assessment

LLM assessment uses a language model to evaluate answers. The model is prompted to evaluate the answer based on relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity, and to provide an overall score and list of issues.

## Answer Validation

Answer validation determines whether an answer meets quality standards. An answer is considered valid if:

- It is not filtered by the content filter
- Its quality score is above the configured threshold (default: 0.5)

## Answer Improvement

If an answer doesn't meet quality standards, the system attempts to improve it:

- If the answer was filtered, a safe alternative is generated
- If the answer has quality issues, the system generates an improved answer that addresses the identified issues

## Configuration

Quality control can be configured in the system configuration:

```yaml
generation:
  # Quality control settings
  filter_content: true  # Whether to filter content
  validate_answers: true  # Whether to validate answers
  filter_level: "medium"  # Filtering level: none, low, medium, high
  quality_assessor: "simple"  # Assessment strategy: simple, llm
  quality_threshold: 0.5  # Minimum quality score for acceptance
  improve_answers: true  # Whether to attempt to improve low-quality answers
```

## Usage

Quality control is automatically applied when generating answers using the `Generator` class:

```python
from knowledge_base.core.config import Config
from knowledge_base.generation.generator import Generator

config = Config()
generator = Generator(config)

# Generate an answer with quality control
answer = await generator.generate(query, chunks)

# Generate an answer without quality control
answer = await generator.generate(query, chunks, validate=False)
```

## Extending the System

The quality control system can be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom Content Filters**: Implement more sophisticated content filtering techniques
2. **Custom Quality Assessors**: Implement custom quality assessment strategies
3. **Custom Answer Validators**: Implement custom answer validation logic
4. **Custom Answer Improvement**: Implement custom answer improvement techniques

## Best Practices

- Use the highest filter level appropriate for your use case
- Use LLM assessment for more accurate quality assessment, but be aware of the performance impact
- Set the quality threshold based on your requirements
- Enable answer improvement to automatically handle low-quality answers
