# Overview
This document outlines the tasks required to improve the performance and reliability of the `mcp` research knowledge base multi-agent system. The focus is on optimizing the advanced features like the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, ensuring the quality of the knowledge base, and exploring new capabilities like multimodal support.

# Core Features

## 1. ToT Framework Performance Optimization
- **Feature:** Implement a lightweight, heuristic-based evaluation function for the ToT framework.
- **Importance:** To make the ToT framework practical and efficient by avoiding expensive LLM calls for node evaluation.
- **High-Level-Works:** The `OrchestratorAgent` will use this function to quickly assess the value of different reasoning paths in the ToT, enabling effective pruning.

- **Feature:** Implement Beam Search pruning for the ToT framework.
- **Importance:** To drastically reduce the search space of the ToT algorithm, preventing "combinatorial explosion" and making the search for solutions more efficient.
- **High-Level-Works:** The `OrchestratorAgent` will only keep the top-K most promising reasoning paths at each step of the ToT exploration.

- **Feature:** Add configurable hard limits (max depth, max nodes) to the ToT exploration.
- **Importance:** To guarantee that the ToT algorithm terminates within a predictable time, preventing resource exhaustion.
- **High-Level-Works:** The `OrchestratorAgent` will have configurable parameters to stop the ToT exploration when certain limits are reached.

## 2. Knowledge Quality and RAG Accuracy Enhancement
- **Feature:** Implement a knowledge staging area.
- **Importance:** To prevent low-quality or unverified information from "polluting" the main knowledge base, thus improving the reliability of RAG outputs.
- **High-Level-Works:** The `KnowledgeMaintenanceAgent` will place new knowledge in a staging index. A validation step (automated or manual) is required before the `KnowledgeStorageAgent` merges it into the main knowledge base.

- **Feature:** Implement source credibility weighting.
- **Importance:** To allow the RAG system to prioritize information from more reliable sources, improving the accuracy of generated answers.
- **High-Level-Works:** The `KnowledgeProcessingAgent` will add a `trust_score` to knowledge chunks based on their source. The `KnowledgeRetrievalAgent` will use this score as a weighting factor during result re-ranking.

## 3. Multimodal Capability Prototyping
- **Feature:** Prototype multimodal data processing and storage.
- **Importance:** To explore the technical feasibility of extending the knowledge base to include non-textual data like images.
- **High-Level-Works:** Create a new example script (`run_multimodal_demo.py`) that demonstrates processing an image (e.g., with a CLIP model) and storing its vector representation. This will involve modifications to the `KnowledgeProcessingAgent`.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **Foundation:** The tasks for ToT optimization and knowledge quality are independent and can be worked on in parallel.
2.  **Prototyping:** The multimodal prototyping is a separate, lower-priority exploration.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical Challenge (ToT):** Designing a truly effective yet lightweight heuristic for ToT evaluation is challenging.
- **Mitigation:** Start with a simple heuristic and iterate. The primary goal is to reduce reliance on expensive LLM calls.
- **Risk (Knowledge Staging):** The validation process for the staging area could become a bottleneck.
- **Mitigation:** Start with a simple automated validation and allow for manual override.
