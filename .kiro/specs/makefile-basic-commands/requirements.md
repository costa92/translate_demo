# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the project's Makefile by adding basic commands for common development tasks, specifically focusing on poetry-based package management and application execution. The improved Makefile will provide standardized commands for installing dependencies and running the application, making the development workflow more consistent and efficient.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use simple make commands to install project dependencies using Poetry, so that I can quickly set up my development environment without remembering complex Poetry commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `make install` THEN the system SHALL execute Poetry install to set up all project dependencies
2. WHEN a developer runs `make install-dev` THEN the system SHALL install development dependencies in addition to regular dependencies
3. IF Poetry is not installed THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message instructing how to install Poetry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use make commands to run the application, so that I can quickly start the application without remembering specific entry points or parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `make run` THEN the system SHALL execute the main application using Poetry
2. WHEN a developer runs `make run-api` THEN the system SHALL start the API server
3. IF any required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Makefile to include help documentation, so that I can easily discover available commands without reading the Makefile code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `make help` or just `make` THEN the system SHALL display a list of available commands with descriptions
2. WHEN displaying help THEN the system SHALL group commands by their purpose (e.g., setup, execution, testing)
