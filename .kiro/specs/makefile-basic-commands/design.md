# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the implementation of basic commands in the project's Makefile, focusing on Poetry-based dependency management and application execution. The Makefile will provide a standardized interface for common development tasks, making the workflow more consistent and efficient across different development environments.

## Architecture

The Makefile will follow a modular design with clearly defined sections for different types of commands:

1. **Help Section**: Contains the default target and documentation for all available commands
2. **Setup Section**: Commands for installing dependencies and setting up the development environment
3. **Execution Section**: Commands for running the application in different modes
4. **Utility Section**: Helper commands and other utilities

Each command will be implemented as a Makefile target with appropriate dependencies and will include comments explaining its purpose.

## Components and Interfaces

### Help System

The help system will be implemented as the default target that runs when `make` is executed without arguments. It will:

- Display a formatted list of available commands
- Group commands by category
- Include a brief description for each command

```makefile
# Example implementation
.PHONY: help
help:
	@echo "Usage: make [target]"
	@echo ""
	@echo "Targets:"
	@echo "  install      Install project dependencies using Poetry"
	# Additional commands...
```

### Setup Commands

Setup commands will handle dependency installation using Poetry:

- `make install`: Installs project dependencies using Poetry
- `make install-dev`: Installs development dependencies in addition to regular dependencies

These commands will include error checking to verify that Poetry is installed and provide helpful error messages if it's not.

### Execution Commands

Execution commands will provide standardized ways to run the application:

- `make run`: Runs the main application using Poetry
- `make run-api`: Starts the API server

These commands will use Poetry's run command to ensure the application runs in the correct virtual environment.

## Data Models

Not applicable for this feature as it doesn't involve data modeling.

## Error Handling

The Makefile will implement basic error handling through:

1. **Prerequisite Checking**: Commands will check for required tools (e.g., Poetry) before execution
2. **Informative Error Messages**: Clear error messages will be displayed when prerequisites are not met
3. **Exit Codes**: Commands will return appropriate exit codes on failure

Example error handling pattern:

```makefile
install:
	@command -v poetry >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "Poetry is not installed. Please install it first: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation"; exit 1; }
	@echo "Installing dependencies..."
	@poetry install
```

## Testing Strategy

Testing for the Makefile will be manual, focusing on:

1. **Functionality Testing**: Verify that each command performs its intended function
2. **Error Handling Testing**: Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed when prerequisites are not met
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure commands work on different operating systems (if applicable)

A simple test procedure will be:

1. Run `make help` to verify the help system works
2. Run each command and verify it performs as expected
3. Simulate error conditions (e.g., rename Poetry temporarily) and verify error messages
