# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Unified Knowledge Base System aims to integrate two existing knowledge base systems into a single, cohesive platform. Currently, the project has two separate knowledge base implementations: a modern RAG system with a layered architecture (`knowledge_base/`) and a multi-agent knowledge base system (`src/agents/knowledge_base/`). These systems have overlapping functionality but different architectures. The goal is to create a unified system that combines the strengths of both approaches, providing a consistent, efficient, and extensible knowledge management solution.
