# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Knowledge Base API Runner is a component that initializes and runs the knowledge base API server. It provides a simple way to start the knowledge base service with proper configuration and ensures the service is running correctly in the background. This component is essential for applications that need to interact with the knowledge base through its API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily initialize and run the knowledge base API server, so that I can integrate it with my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL initialize the knowledge base with default settings
2. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL create a proper configuration for the API server
3. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL start the API server in a background thread
4. WHEN the API server is starting THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback to the user
5. WHEN the API server is running THEN the system SHALL ensure it's accessible at the configured host and port

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to customize the knowledge base API server configuration, so that I can adapt it to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the API server THEN the system SHALL allow customization of the host address
2. WHEN initializing the API server THEN the system SHALL allow customization of the port number
3. WHEN initializing the API server THEN the system SHALL allow enabling or disabling API documentation
4. WHEN customizing the configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the provided values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the knowledge base API server to run reliably in the background, so that my application can focus on its main functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API server is started THEN the system SHALL run it in a daemon thread to avoid blocking the main application
2. WHEN the main application exits THEN the system SHALL ensure the API server thread is properly terminated
3. WHEN the API server encounters an error THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN the API server is running THEN the system SHALL provide a way to check its status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have proper imports and dependencies in the script, so that it runs without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL import all necessary modules and dependencies
2. WHEN importing dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle potential import errors gracefully
3. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with the knowledge base API module
